		Request and Response Messages</h2>
	<p>In this article, we glance at Http request and response
		document. A HTTP request document and HTTP response document will be
		designed with some protocol and this protocol is the http protocol. A
		browser prepares a request message when we try to access a web site
		and send it to the server. The server reads the request document,
		which is sent by a browser,and process the request. after The server
		process the request, server prepares a response document that could be
		sent back to the browser.</p>

		Request Message</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Every request message/document has two parts one is header
			part and other is body part which is request body</li>
		<li>In the header part of a request message, A browser puts all
			headers information and whatever we submit the form data that will be
			placed in the body part of the request message</li>
		<li>The form data we often call it as payload</li>

		<li>When we log onto a web site, The login credential will be
			taken by the browser and it prepares a request document by simply
			placing credentials in the body part of the request. you could see in
			the below image how a response a request message would be</li>

		<li>A server reads request message, and processes the request
			once the response for the request is ready the server prepares
			response message by simply placing response content in response body</li>

		<li>After checking credentials are valid or not,the server sends
