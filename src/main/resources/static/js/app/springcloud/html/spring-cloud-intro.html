 -->					<p class="card-text mb-auto text-dark">Spring cloud has numerous tools that provides us to build distributed systems in easy manner. in distributed systems, a complete  application will be divided into small services and these services works independently on their own servers.
					 they can exchange the data  with each other through  rest service. To provide effective communication among the services ,spring cloud has provided numerous useful tools.</p>
					 We have some common patterns in distributed systems(such as Service Discovery,Load-balancing,Circuit breaker design pattern,intelligent routing,and configuration management..etc)<br>
					
              <h5 style="padding-top: 10px;padding-bottom: 10px" class="text-danger">Some spring cloud tools</h5>
                      <ul>
                          <li><a class="font-weight-bold" href="">Spring cloud config:-</a> In distributed systems, every service is a separate spring boot application that can have a specific configuration.instead providing configuration in the application, we can centralize the all small service applications's configuration with this spring cloud config tool </li>
                          <li><a class="font-weight-bold" href="">Spring Cloud OpenFeign:-</a> In distributed systems, sometimes one service has to call other service. to do that spring frame work has provided RestTemplate class to consume rest service however it doesn't provide load balancing. the draw back of RestTemplate could be fulfilled  by spring cloud OpenFiegn tool </li>
                          <li><a class="font-weight-bold" href="">Spring Cloud Netflix:- </a>Integration with various Netflix OSS components (Eureka, Hystrix, Zuul etc.).</li>
                          <li><a class="font-weight-bold" href="">Spring Cloud Sleuth:-</a>In distributed systems, we would see some services could call other services, to trace the logs in distributed systems spring cloud Sleuth helps us</li>
