	<h2 style="color: purple; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif">java.lang.Object 's hashCode()</h2>
	<p>In this article, we glance at hashCode().The JVM generates a
		unique idetifier for every object that has been created. To generate a
		unique number, jvm uses the address of the object and some algorithms.
		it deosnt mean that the hash code is the actual address of the object

		class="text-success">Where could it be helpful?</h5>
	<p>The JVM uses this hash code of objects during insertion ( but
		also getting an element from ) of the objects into hashing related
		data structures such as HashTable,HashMap,HashSet etc. Have a look at
		code snippet of Java.util.HashMap. by default 16 buckets gets created
		for storing key,value pairs. It has a resizable array of Nodes we
		often call a cell as bucket.

         transient Node<K ,V>[] table;
                            
            static final int hash(Object key) {
                    int h;
                       return (key == null) ? 0 : (h = key.hashCode()) ^ (h >>> 16);
             }

            arrayIndex = (n - 1) & hash;
                           
            here n is  array size which is  total buckets in the HashMap

    
		
		</pre>
	</div>
	HashMap uses hash code of key to find the index of Node[] to place the
	key,value pair

		class="text-success">Benifits of hashCode()?</h5>
	<p>Searching an element in a Hashing related data structures could
		be easy and the time complexity is O(1)</p>
	in the java.lang.Object class

	<div style="background-color: cornsilk">
		<pre>
                                    
      public native int hashCode();

  </pre>
	</div>

	We are allowed overriding hashCode() in our classes but the
	implementation must return a unique number otherwise we face
	performance issues when we use those objects in Hashing datastructres
	.The java document says Whenever it is invoked on the same object more
	than once during an execution of a Java application, the hashCode
	method must consistently return the same integer
